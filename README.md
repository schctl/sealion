# sealion

A toy chess engine that aims to be compatible with UCI and have a decently strong elo.

## Features

Sealion currently supports these features, with the remaining planned out:

- [x] Board representation and FEN parsing
- [x] Extended position information and move generation [`(borked #3)`](https://github.com/schctl/sealion/issues/3)
- [ ] UCI support ([#4](https://github.com/schctl/sealion/pull/4))
- [ ] Static evaluation of positions
- [ ] A (graphical) self-play-testing framework
